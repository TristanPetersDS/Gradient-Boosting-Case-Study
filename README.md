# Titanic Gradient Boosting Case Study

## Overview
This case study explores gradient boosting for both regression and classification tasks using the Titanic dataset. The goal is to demonstrate how gradient boosting iteratively refines predictions by learning from residual errors.

## Objectives
- Understand how gradient boosting improves model performance.
- Apply gradient boosting to a regression task.
- Implement gradient boosting for a classification problem (Titanic survival prediction).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset, which contains information on passengers, including demographics, ticket class, and survival status.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Implementing gradient boosting models.
- Model evaluation and interpretation.
